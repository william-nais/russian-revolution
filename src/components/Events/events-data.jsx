                <br></br>
                <p>On <b>March 15th, 1917</b>, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated with the military no longer on his side and the whole Empire in chaos. And so 300 years of Romanov rule came to an end that day.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>As a result, the Russian Provisional Government took the place as the official government, while the Petrograd Soviets issued orders to workers and the peasants. This Dual Power conudrum was delicate and fragile.</p>

                <p>The April Theses were a series of directives issued by Lenin himself in April 1917.</p>
                <p>In these directives, Lenin condems the Provisional Government as bourgeois and urging non-support (due its false promises), and WWI as imperalist. He also advocated power to the peasants and proletarians through the Soviets, proposes agrarian reform, renaming the Bolsheviks as the Communist Party, and calls for the formation of a new revolutionary International. </p>

Characterised by multiple unsuccessful protests and demonstrations by soldiers, workers, and sailors, the Provisional Government ordered troops to fire upon them and many leaders (such as Leon Trotsky) were arrested and put into prison.

                <p>Leon Trotsky organised the Bolshevik militias, but in the end, no fighting was necessary as the militias walked into key infrastructures and took control.</p>

                <p>Kerensky, who is the Prime Minister of Russia, just managed to escape as the Bolsheviks surrounded the Winter Palace, trapping and sieging the Provisional Government inside.

                <p>The Palace was guarded by a force caleld the Battalion of Death who surrendered shortly after. And just like that, Lenin and the Bolsheviks had won and now has power over Russia.</p>

                <p>Following Lenin's coup against the Provisional Government, this new source of power was not universally accepted across Russia, and hence the Republic (renamed to the Russian Republic after Nicholas II abdicated) descended into a full-blown civil war.</p>

                <p>The two main sides were the Red Army (a military fighting for the Bolsheviks) and the White Army (a loosely & disunified allied force that was counter-revolutionary). The Red Army took control of the industrial grounds of the nation whilst the White Army took the vast and underdeveloped areas. The Red Army pushed through and both sides committed serious attrocities on either side.</p>
